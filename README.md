# IRLS-and-Physarum-Dynamics
This repository provides source code for the IRLS algorithm and a the Physarum Dynamics for the basis pursuit problem that were shown closely related in the paper https://arxiv.org/abs/1601.02712.



### Using the code

See "example.py" for a simple demonstration on how the code can be used.
